 <div class="question">87. What is `IServiceScopeFactory` used for?</div>
 <div class="answer">`IServiceScopeFactory` is used to create scopes for resolving services with a scoped lifetime. It provides a way to create `IServiceScope` instances, which manage the lifetime of scoped services.</div>

 <div class="question">88. How do you perform asynchronous operations in ASP.NET Core?</div>
 <div class="answer">Asynchronous operations in ASP.NET Core are performed using the `async` and `await` keywords. They enable non-blocking operations and improve scalability by allowing the application to handle multiple requests concurrently.</div>

 <div class="question">89. What is `IOptionsMonitor<T>`?</div>
 <div class="answer">`IOptionsMonitor<T>` is an interface that provides a way to monitor and react to changes in configuration settings. It allows for getting current values of configuration and subscribing to change notifications.</div>

 <div class="question">90. What is the purpose of the `UseExceptionHandler` middleware?</div>
 <div class="answer">The `UseExceptionHandler` middleware is used to handle exceptions that occur during request processing. It provides a way to specify a custom error handling route or page to display error information to the user.</div>

 <div class="question">91. What is the `IApplicationLifetime` interface used for?</div>
 <div class="answer">The `IApplicationLifetime` interface provides events and methods for managing the application's lifecycle. It allows you to handle events such as application start, stopping, and stop, enabling custom logic at different stages of the application's lifetime.</div>

 <div class="question">92. How do you use `IOptions` for configuration in .NET Core?</div>
 <div class="answer">`IOptions<T>` is used to access configuration settings in a strongly-typed manner. You define a POCO class that represents the configuration section, configure it in the `ConfigureServices` method, and inject `IOptions<T>` to access these settings throughout the application.</div>

 <div class="question">93. What is the `UseHttpsRedirection` middleware used for?</div>
 <div class="answer">The `UseHttpsRedirection` middleware is used to automatically redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS. It ensures that all communication between the client and server is encrypted and secure.</div>

 <div class="question">94. What is `IWebHost` and how is it used?</div>
 <div class="answer">`IWebHost` is an interface that represents a web host in ASP.NET Core. It manages the application’s request processing pipeline and is responsible for starting and running the application. It is typically configured using `IWebHostBuilder`.</div>

 <div class="question">95. How do you implement dependency injection in .NET Core?</div>
 <div class="answer">Dependency injection in .NET Core is implemented by registering services in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Startup` class using `IServiceCollection`. Services can be registered with different lifetimes (transient, scoped, singleton) and are then injected into classes via constructor injection.</div>

 <div class="question">96. What is the `UseStaticFiles` middleware used for?</div>
 <div class="answer">The `UseStaticFiles` middleware is used to serve static files, such as images, CSS, and JavaScript, from the `wwwroot` directory or other specified locations. It allows the application to handle requests for static resources efficiently.</div>

 <div class="question">97. What is `IOptions<T>` and how is it used?</div>
 <div class="answer">`IOptions<T>` is an interface used to access configuration settings in a strongly-typed manner. It allows you to bind configuration settings to a POCO class and inject it into services or components to access configuration values.</div>

 <div class="question">98. What is `IConfiguration` and how is it used?</div>
 <div class="answer">`IConfiguration` is an interface used to access configuration settings from various sources like JSON files, environment variables, and command-line arguments. It allows you to retrieve configuration values and bind them to strongly-typed objects.</div>

 <div class="question">99. How do you configure error handling in .NET Core?</div>
 <div class="answer">Error handling in .NET Core can be configured using middleware such as `UseExceptionHandler`, which allows you to specify a custom error handling page or route. Additionally, you can use exception filters and logging to manage and report errors.</div>

 <div class="question">100. What is `IServiceProvider` and how is it used?</div>
 <div class="answer">`IServiceProvider` is an interface used to resolve services from the dependency injection container. It provides methods for obtaining instances of registered services and is typically used for service resolution in classes that are not directly injected.</div>
