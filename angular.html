            <h2>Basics</h2>

            <div class="question">1. What is Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is maintained by Google and provides a comprehensive set of tools and libraries for developing web applications.</div>

            <div class="question">2. What are the key features of Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Key features of Angular include a component-based architecture, dependency injection, a powerful template language, routing capabilities, and an integrated development environment (IDE) for building scalable and maintainable applications.</div>

            <div class="question">3. What is a component in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">A component in Angular is a building block of the application that encapsulates a view (HTML), data (TypeScript), and behavior (CSS). It consists of a class that defines the component's logic and a template that defines its view.</div>

            <div class="question">4. What is a module in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">A module in Angular is a container for a group of related components, services, directives, and pipes. It helps organize an application into cohesive blocks of functionality. The root module is called `AppModule`, and other modules can be feature modules or shared modules.</div>

            <div class="question">5. What is data binding in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Data binding in Angular is a mechanism for synchronizing data between the model (component class) and the view (template). Angular supports two-way data binding, which allows changes in the model to be reflected in the view and vice versa.</div>

            <div class="question">6. What are Angular directives?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular directives are special markers in the DOM that tell the Angular compiler to do something with a DOM element or component. There are three types of directives: components, structural directives (e.g., `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`), and attribute directives.</div>

            <div class="question">7. What is the purpose of `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `ngOnInit` lifecycle hook is used for initialization logic in a component. It is called once, after the first `ngOnChanges`, and is used to perform any additional setup that is needed for the component after Angular has initialized the component's inputs.</div>

            <div class="question">8. What is the difference between `ngOnChanges` and `ngOnInit`?</div>
            <div class="answer">`ngOnChanges` is called when any data-bound input properties change, while `ngOnInit` is called once, after the component's inputs have been initialized. `ngOnChanges` is useful for reacting to changes in input properties, whereas `ngOnInit` is used for component initialization.</div>

            <div class="question">9. What is Angular CLI?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a command-line tool that helps to create, manage, and build Angular applications. It provides commands for scaffolding components, services, modules, and other Angular artifacts, as well as running tests and building the application for deployment.</div>

            <div class="question">10. How do you create a new Angular project using Angular CLI?</div>
            <div class="answer">To create a new Angular project using Angular CLI, run the command `ng new project-name`. This will generate a new Angular project with the specified name, along with the default configuration and directory structure.</div>

            <div class="question">11. What is the purpose of the `@NgModule` decorator?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `@NgModule` decorator is used to define an Angular module. It provides metadata about the module, including declarations, imports, exports, providers, and bootstrap components, which Angular uses to organize and manage application components and services.</div>

            <div class="question">12. What is the role of `bootstrap` in Angular modules?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `bootstrap` array in an Angular module specifies the root component(s) that Angular should bootstrap when the application starts. This is the entry point for the application and the component that Angular will use to start rendering the application.</div>

            <div class="question">13. How do you pass data from a parent component to a child component?</div>
            <div class="answer">Data can be passed from a parent component to a child component using `@Input` properties. The parent component binds a value to the child's `@Input` property, allowing the child component to access and use the passed data.</div>

            <div class="question">14. What is `@Output` and how is it used?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `@Output` decorator is used to define an event that a component can emit to its parent component. It is typically used with `EventEmitter` to send custom events from the child component to the parent component.</div>

            <div class="question">15. What are pipes in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Pipes in Angular are used to transform data in templates. They allow you to format data before displaying it to the user. Angular provides several built-in pipes, such as `DatePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, and `DecimalPipe`, and you can also create custom pipes.</div>

            <div class="question">16. What is the purpose of `ngIf` and `ngFor` directives?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `ngIf` directive conditionally includes or excludes a template from the DOM based on an expression. The `ngFor` directive iterates over a collection and renders the template for each item in the collection. Both directives are used for dynamic rendering of content.</div>

            <div class="question">17. How do you handle form validation in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Form validation in Angular can be handled using either template-driven forms or reactive forms. Template-driven forms use Angular's built-in directives in the template to manage validation, while reactive forms use `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormBuilder` to handle validation programmatically.</div>

            <div class="question">18. What is a `FormGroup` in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">A `FormGroup` is a collection of `FormControl` instances in Angular's reactive forms. It represents a group of related form controls, allowing you to manage and validate the entire group of controls together.</div>

            <div class="question">19. What is the `ngModel` directive used for?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `ngModel` directive is used for two-way data binding in Angular forms. It binds the value of an input, select, or textarea element to a property in the component's class, and updates the property when the user changes the input.</div>

            <div class="question">20. What are Angular forms?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular forms are used to handle user input and validation in Angular applications. They can be either template-driven or reactive. Template-driven forms rely on Angular's built-in directives in the template, while reactive forms provide a more flexible and programmatic approach.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="components" class="section">
            <h2>Components</h2>

            <div class="question">21. What is the role of the `@Component` decorator?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `@Component` decorator is used to define a class as an Angular component. It provides metadata about the component, such as its selector, template, and style, which Angular uses to create and manage the component.</div>

            <div class="question">22. How do you create a component in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">To create a component in Angular, use the Angular CLI command `ng generate component component-name` or `ng g c component-name`. This generates a component class, template, stylesheet, and test files in a directory with the specified name.</div>

            <div class="question">23. What is the purpose of `@Input` and `@Output` decorators?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `@Input` decorator allows a component to receive data from its parent component. The `@Output` decorator allows a component to emit events to its parent component. These decorators are used for component communication and data sharing.</div>

            <div class="question">24. How do you handle user input in Angular components?</div>
            <div class="answer">User input in Angular components can be handled using template-driven forms or reactive forms. Template-driven forms use directives in the template to manage input, while reactive forms use `FormControl`, `FormGroup`, and `FormBuilder` to handle form data programmatically.</div>

            <div class="question">25. What is a service in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">A service in Angular is a class that provides specific functionality and is typically used to share data or logic across multiple components. Services are injected into components or other services using Angular's dependency injection system.</div>

            <div class="question">26. How do you provide a service at the root level?</div>
            <div class="answer">To provide a service at the root level, use the `@Injectable` decorator with the `providedIn: 'root'` option. This makes the service a singleton and ensures that only one instance of the service is created and shared across the entire application.</div>

            <div class="question">27. What is the `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook used for?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `ngOnDestroy` lifecycle hook is used to perform cleanup logic when a component or service is destroyed. It is typically used to unsubscribe from observables, release resources, or perform other cleanup tasks to avoid memory leaks.</div>

            <div class="question">28. What is the difference between a component and a directive?</div>
            <div class="answer">A component is a directive with a view (template) and can be used to create reusable UI elements. A directive, on the other hand, is used to manipulate the DOM or add behavior to existing elements without creating a new view. Components are a type of directive with a template.</div>

            <div class="question">29. What are Angular modules and why are they important?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular modules are a way to organize an Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality. They help in grouping related components, services, directives, and pipes. Modules are important for maintaining a modular and maintainable codebase and for managing dependencies and lazy loading.</div>

            <div class="question">30. How do you use `ngIf` and `ngFor` in Angular templates?</div>
            <div class="answer">`ngIf` is used to conditionally include or exclude elements in the DOM based on an expression. `ngFor` is used to iterate over a collection and create an instance of the template for each item in the collection. Both directives are useful for dynamic rendering of content in templates.</div>

            <div class="question">31. What is the purpose of Angular's dependency injection system?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular's dependency injection (DI) system is used to manage the creation and injection of services and other dependencies into components and services. It helps to decouple the components from their dependencies, making the application more modular and testable.</div>

            <div class="question">32. What is the `@Injectable` decorator used for?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `@Injectable` decorator is used to define a class as an injectable service. It allows Angular to create instances of the service and inject it into components or other services. The decorator also provides metadata about how the service should be provided.</div>

            <div class="question">33. How do you handle HTTP requests in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">HTTP requests in Angular are handled using the `HttpClient` service from `@angular/common/http`. It provides methods for making HTTP requests such as `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete`. It also supports features like request interceptors, response handling, and error handling.</div>

            <div class="question">34. What is the purpose of the `HttpInterceptor`?</div>
            <div class="answer">`HttpInterceptor` is used to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses in Angular applications. It allows you to add custom headers, handle authentication, log requests, or modify responses globally before they reach the application.</div>

            <div class="question">35. What are Angular guards and how are they used?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular guards are used to control access to routes in an application. They can prevent navigation to certain routes or redirect users based on specific conditions. Common types of guards include `CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`, and `CanLoad`.</div>

            <div class="question">36. What is the difference between `CanActivate` and `CanDeactivate` guards?</div>
            <div class="answer">`CanActivate` guard determines whether a route can be activated based on certain conditions, while `CanDeactivate` guard determines whether the user can navigate away from a route, often used for unsaved changes or warnings before leaving the page.</div>

            <div class="question">37. What is lazy loading in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Lazy loading is a technique used to load modules only when they are needed, rather than loading them at the application's startup. This improves application performance and reduces the initial load time. Angular supports lazy loading through feature modules and routing.</div>

            <div class="question">38. How do you implement lazy loading in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">To implement lazy loading in Angular, use the `loadChildren` property in the routing configuration. It specifies the path to the module that should be loaded lazily. For example: `{ path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }`.</div>

            <div class="question">39. What is Angular's change detection mechanism?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular's change detection mechanism is responsible for tracking changes in the application and updating the view accordingly. It uses a strategy called change detection to check for changes in data-bound properties and propagate those changes to the view.</div>

            <div class="question">40. How do you optimize change detection in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">To optimize change detection in Angular, use the `ChangeDetectionStrategy` property in the component decorator. Set it to `OnPush` to reduce the number of checks Angular performs. Additionally, use `trackBy` function in `ngFor` to optimize list rendering and avoid unnecessary DOM updates.</div>
        </div>

        <div id="services" class="section">
            <h2>Services</h2>

            <div class="question">41. How do you create a service in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">To create a service in Angular, use the Angular CLI command `ng generate service service-name` or `ng g s service-name`. This generates a service class with the `@Injectable` decorator, which is used for dependency injection.</div>

            <div class="question">42. What is dependency injection in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Dependency injection (DI) in Angular is a design pattern that allows components and services to be injected with dependencies (such as services) rather than creating them directly. Angular's DI system manages the lifecycle and sharing of these dependencies.</div>

            <div class="question">43. What are injectable services?</div>
            <div class="answer">Injectable services are services marked with the `@Injectable` decorator. This decorator tells Angular that the service can be injected into other components or services. It is a key part of Angular's dependency injection system.</div>

            <div class="question">44. How do you provide a service at the component level?</div>
            <div class="answer">To provide a service at the component level, use the `providers` array in the component decorator. This creates a new instance of the service for the component and its children, isolating it from other components that may use the same service.</div>

            <div class="question">45. What is the purpose of the `HttpClient` service?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `HttpClient` service is used to make HTTP requests and handle responses in Angular applications. It provides methods such as `get`, `post`, `put`, and `delete` to interact with backend APIs and handle data retrieval and submission.</div>

            <div class="question">46. How do you handle errors in HTTP requests?</div>
            <div class="answer">Errors in HTTP requests can be handled using RxJS operators such as `catchError` and `retry`. You can catch and handle errors in an observable chain and provide user-friendly error messages or perform other actions based on the error.</div>

            <div class="question">47. What are Angular interceptors and how are they used?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular interceptors are used to intercept and modify HTTP requests and responses globally. They can be used for tasks such as adding authorization headers, logging requests, or handling errors. Interceptors are implemented using the `HttpInterceptor` interface.</div>

            <div class="question">48. How do you use an `HttpInterceptor` to add authentication headers?</div>
            <div class="answer">To use an `HttpInterceptor` to add authentication headers, implement the `HttpInterceptor` interface and override the `intercept` method. In the `intercept` method, modify the request to include the authentication headers and pass the modified request to the next handler.</div>

            <div class="question">49. What is the role of `NgModule` in Angular services?</div>
            <div class="answer">`NgModule` is used to organize Angular services into cohesive blocks of functionality. Services can be provided in the root module or feature modules using the `providers` array. `NgModule` helps in managing the scope and availability of services within different parts of the application.</div>

            <div class="question">50. How do you test Angular services?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular services can be tested using Angular's testing utilities and the Jasmine framework. You can use the `TestBed` to configure the testing module, inject the service, and verify its behavior using assertions and spies to mock dependencies.</div>

        <div id="routing" class="section">
            <h2>Routing</h2>

            <div class="question">51. What is Angular routing?</div>
            <div class="answer">Angular routing is the mechanism for navigating between different views or pages in a single-page application (SPA). It allows you to define routes and configure navigation within the application using the Angular Router.</div>

            <div class="question">52. How do you configure routes in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">Routes in Angular are configured using the `RouterModule.forRoot` method in the application's root module. You define an array of route objects, where each object maps a path to a component. Routes are then registered with the router.</div>

            <div class="question">53. What is a route guard?</div>
            <div class="answer">A route guard is a feature in Angular that allows you to control access to routes based on specific conditions. Route guards implement interfaces like `CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`, `Resolve`, and `CanLoad` to protect routes and manage navigation.</div>

            <div class="question">54. How do you implement lazy loading in Angular routing?</div>
            <div class="answer">To implement lazy loading in Angular routing, use the `loadChildren` property in the route configuration. This property specifies a function that returns a promise for the module to be loaded lazily. For example: `{ path: 'feature', loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule) }`.</div>

            <div class="question">55. What is the purpose of `RouterModule`?</div>
            <div class="answer">`RouterModule` is an Angular module that provides the services and directives necessary for routing in Angular applications. It includes features for configuring routes, navigating between views, and handling route parameters and guards.</div>

            <div class="question">56. How do you handle route parameters?</div>
            <div class="answer">Route parameters are handled using the `ActivatedRoute` service. You can inject this service into your component and use its `params` observable to access and respond to route parameters in the URL.</div>

            <div class="question">57. What is the purpose of `RouterLink` directive?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `RouterLink` directive is used to navigate to a different route within an Angular application. It binds a route path to an element, allowing users to navigate to the specified route when they interact with the element.</div>

            <div class="question">58. How do you handle navigation between routes programmatically?</div>
            <div class="answer">To handle navigation programmatically, use the `Router` service's `navigate` or `navigateByUrl` methods. These methods allow you to navigate to a different route based on route paths or URL strings.</div>

            <div class="question">59. What is a route resolver?</div>
            <div class="answer">A route resolver is used to retrieve data before a route is activated. It implements the `Resolve` interface and provides a way to fetch data that is needed for the route before the component is instantiated.</div>

            <div class="question">60. How do you implement route guards in Angular?</div>
            <div class="answer">To implement route guards, create a service that implements one of the route guard interfaces (e.g., `CanActivate`, `CanDeactivate`). Then, configure the route to use the guard service by adding it to the `canActivate` or `canDeactivate` properties in the route configuration.</div>

            <div class="question">61. What is Angular's Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation?</div>
            <div class="answer">Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation is a process that compiles Angular templates and components at build time rather than runtime. This results in faster rendering and smaller bundle sizes, as the application is compiled to JavaScript code before it is served to the client.</div>

            <div class="question">62. What is Angular's Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation?</div>
            <div class="answer">Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation is a process where Angular templates and components are compiled at runtime in the browser.
