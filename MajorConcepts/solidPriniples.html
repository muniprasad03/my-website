    <h1>SOLID Principles and C# .NET Interview Questions</h1>

    <!-- SOLID Principles Section -->
    <div class="solid">
        <h2>SOLID Principles Theory</h2>
        <p>SOLID is a set of five design principles that help developers write clean, maintainable, and scalable software. The principles are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)</h3>
                <p>A class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should only have one job or responsibility. This promotes high cohesion and low coupling in software design.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP)</h3>
                <p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add new functionality to a system without changing existing code.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)</h3>
                <p>Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program. In other words, a derived class must be substitutable for its base class.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)</h3>
                <p>Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of having a large interface, create multiple smaller, more specific interfaces that clients can implement as needed.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)</h3>
                <p>High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions. This encourages the use of dependency injection.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Top 100 C# .NET Interview Questions and Answers</h2>
    
    <div class="question-answer">
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="question">1. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">A value type holds data directly, while a reference type holds a reference (pointer) to the data. Examples of value types are structs and enums, whereas reference types include objects, arrays, and delegates.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">2. What is the purpose of the "using" statement in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "using" statement is used to ensure that resources like file streams or database connections are properly disposed of after use. It helps prevent memory leaks.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">3. Explain the difference between "ref" and "out" parameters in C#.</div>
                <div class="answer">Both "ref" and "out" are used to pass parameters by reference. However, with "ref", the variable must be initialized before it is passed to the method, while with "out", the variable doesn't need to be initialized before passing it.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">4. What is the difference between "abstract class" and "interface" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">An abstract class can have both abstract (unimplemented) and non-abstract (implemented) methods, while an interface can only contain method signatures without any implementation. Additionally, a class can implement multiple interfaces but can inherit only one abstract class.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">5. What is the purpose of the "async" and "await" keywords in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "async" keyword is used to define an asynchronous method, and "await" is used to pause the execution of the method until the awaited task completes. This allows for non-blocking I/O operations.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">6. What are delegates in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Delegates are type-safe function pointers in C#. They hold references to methods and allow you to invoke those methods indirectly. Delegates are commonly used in event handling and callback mechanisms.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">7. Explain the concept of "Garbage Collection" in .NET.</div>
                <div class="answer">Garbage collection in .NET is the automatic memory management process where the runtime reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer in use by the application. This prevents memory leaks and helps manage memory efficiently.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">8. What is the difference between "String" and "StringBuilder" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "String" class is immutable, meaning once a string object is created, it cannot be changed. "StringBuilder", on the other hand, is mutable and is used when you need to modify a string repeatedly, such as in loops, to avoid performance issues with string concatenation.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">9. What is the use of the "lock" statement in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "lock" statement is used to ensure that only one thread can access a particular section of code at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">10. What is the difference between "Array" and "ArrayList" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">An "Array" has a fixed size, and elements are of the same data type. An "ArrayList" is dynamic, can grow in size, and can hold elements of different data types.</div>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="question-answer">
        <!-- Repeat similar structure for more questions (11 to 100) -->
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="question">11. What is an event in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">An event in C# is a way to provide notifications to other classes or objects about changes or actions. It is typically used in the publisher-subscriber model, where one object raises an event and other objects listen for it.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">12. What is the difference between "IEnumerable" and "IEnumerator" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">"IEnumerable" provides the ability to iterate over a collection, and it has a method "GetEnumerator" that returns an IEnumerator. "IEnumerator" is responsible for the actual iteration and contains methods like "MoveNext" and "Current" to traverse the collection.</div>
            </li>
            <!-- Continue with other questions up to 100 -->
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="question">13. What is a "namespace" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">A namespace is a container for classes, structs, enums, and interfaces, providing a way to organize code and avoid name conflicts between classes or other types with the same name.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">14. What is a "constructor" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">A constructor is a special method that is called when an object of a class is instantiated. It is used to initialize the object's properties and allocate resources.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">15. What is the difference between "const" and "readonly" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">A "const" field is evaluated at compile-time and cannot be changed after compilation. A "readonly" field can be assigned a value either during declaration or in the constructor, and its value can be set only once during object initialization.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">16. What is "boxing" and "unboxing" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Boxing is the process of converting a value type to a reference type (e.g., converting an integer to an object). Unboxing is the reverse process of converting a reference type back to a value type.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">17. What is a "delegate" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">A delegate is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. It allows methods to be passed as parameters or used as callbacks.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">18. What is "lambda expression" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">A lambda expression is a shorthand way of writing an anonymous function or method. It can be used to create delegate instances or implement LINQ queries more concisely.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">19. Explain the difference between "String" and "StringBuilder".</div>
                <div class="answer">The "String" class in C# is immutable, meaning once a string object is created, it cannot be changed. "StringBuilder" is mutable, allowing for efficient modification of strings, particularly useful when concatenating in loops.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">20. What are "Extension Methods" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Extension methods allow you to add new functionality to existing types (classes, interfaces, etc.) without modifying their source code. They are defined as static methods in static classes but are called as if they were instance methods.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">21. What is the purpose of the "virtual" keyword in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "virtual" keyword is used to declare a method or property that can be overridden in derived classes. It allows method overriding for polymorphism.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">22. What is the difference between "public", "private", "protected", and "internal" access modifiers?</div>
                <div class="answer">"public" allows access from any class, "private" restricts access to the containing class, "protected" allows access from the containing class or derived classes, and "internal" allows access within the same assembly.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">23. What is "method overloading" and "method overriding" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Method overloading allows you to define multiple methods with the same name but with different parameters. Method overriding involves redefining a base class method in a derived class with the same signature to provide specific behavior.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">24. What are "generics" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Generics allow you to define classes, methods, and interfaces with a placeholder for the data type. They provide type safety and performance improvements by allowing for reusability without compromising on type-specific functionality.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">25. What is the difference between "IEnumerable" and "ICollection" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">"IEnumerable" is a basic interface for collections that allows iteration over the collection, while "ICollection" is a more advanced interface that includes methods for adding, removing, and checking items in the collection, in addition to iteration.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">26. What is "Lazy Initialization" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Lazy initialization refers to deferring the creation of an object or the execution of an operation until it is actually needed. It is often used with the "Lazy<T>" class in C# to improve performance.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">27. What is the use of the "async" keyword in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "async" keyword is used to define a method that will run asynchronously. It allows the method to execute without blocking the calling thread, making the application more responsive.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">28. What is "dependency injection" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Dependency Injection is a design pattern that deals with how objects are created and injected into classes. It allows for loose coupling by passing dependencies from the outside, rather than having the class create them itself.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">29. What is the difference between "abstract class" and "interface"?</div>
                <div class="answer">An abstract class can have both implemented and unimplemented methods, while an interface can only define method signatures. A class can inherit from only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">30. What are "events" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Events in C# are used to notify other classes or objects when something happens. They follow a publisher-subscriber model and are often used with delegates to allow subscribers to handle events when they occur.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">31. What is the "new" keyword used for in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "new" keyword in C# is used for creating instances of types (like classes or arrays) and for hiding members of the base class that are being overridden in the derived class.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">32. Explain the difference between "continue" and "break" statements in C#.</div>
                <div class="answer">The "continue" statement skips the current iteration of a loop and moves to the next one, while the "break" statement terminates the loop entirely.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">33. What are "tuples" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Tuples are lightweight data structures in C# that allow you to group multiple values of different types into a single object. They can hold up to eight elements and are commonly used to return multiple values from a method.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">34. What is the use of "yield" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "yield" keyword is used to define an iterator block, enabling a method to return a sequence of values one at a time, without having to build the entire collection in memory at once. It simplifies the code for working with collections lazily.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">35. What is "dynamic" typing in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">"dynamic" is a keyword in C# used to define a type that is resolved at runtime instead of compile-time. It allows for more flexibility in working with objects whose types are not known until execution.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">36. What are "anonymous methods" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Anonymous methods in C# are methods that do not have a name. They are often used for short-lived event handlers or delegate assignments.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">37. How do you handle exceptions in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Exceptions in C# are handled using try-catch blocks. The "try" block contains the code that may throw an exception, and the "catch" block handles the exception. Optionally, a "finally" block can be used to execute code regardless of whether an exception was thrown.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">38. What is the difference between "Array" and "List" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">An "Array" has a fixed size and its elements must be of the same type, while a "List" is dynamic, allowing elements to be added or removed, and can grow in size as needed.</div>
            </li>
            <!-- Continue up to 100 -->
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <div class="question">39. What is the difference between "abstract" and "concrete" classes?</div>
                <div class="answer">An abstract class cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation). A concrete class can be instantiated and has implementations for all its methods.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">40. What is the "foreach" loop in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "foreach" loop is used to iterate through collections like arrays or lists. It automatically handles the iteration process without needing to use an index.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">41. What is the difference between "String" and "Char" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">"String" is a sequence of characters (a collection of characters), while "Char" represents a single character. Strings are immutable, while characters are value types.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">42. What is the use of the "default" keyword in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "default" keyword returns the default value of a type. For example, the default value of a reference type is null, and for value types like int, it’s 0.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">43. What is "event handling" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Event handling in C# involves using delegates to trigger actions when events occur. Event handlers are methods that respond to those events when they are raised.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">44. What is the difference between "override" and "new" keywords?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "override" keyword is used to override a base class method in a derived class, while "new" hides the base class method and creates a new implementation in the derived class. The "new" method does not participate in polymorphism.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">45. What is the "volatile" keyword in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">The "volatile" keyword indicates that a field can be modified by multiple threads and prevents the compiler from caching the value of the field, ensuring the most recent value is always used.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <div class="question">46. What are "attributes" in C#?</div>
                <div class="answer">Attributes in C# are used to add metadata to classes, methods, properties, and other code elements. They can provide additional information or influence code behavior at runtime (e.g., marking methods for serialization).</div>
