        <li>
            <div class="question">1. What is multithreading in .NET?</div>
            <div class="answer">Multithreading is a process of executing multiple threads concurrently in a program. Each thread can perform a part of the task, which helps in improving performance and responsiveness in applications.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">2. What is the difference between a process and a thread?</div>
            <div class="answer">A process is an independent program that has its own memory space, while a thread is a lightweight sub-process that shares the same memory space with other threads in the same process.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">3. What are the advantages of multithreading?</div>
            <div class="answer">Multithreading allows for better resource utilization, faster execution, responsiveness, and parallelism. It is particularly useful for applications with tasks that can be executed independently.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">4. What are the potential issues with multithreading?</div>
            <div class="answer">Issues include race conditions, deadlocks, thread starvation, and thread synchronization problems. Managing concurrency and ensuring thread safety are major challenges in multithreading.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">5. What is the Thread class in .NET?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `Thread` class in .NET is used to create and manage threads. It provides methods for starting, pausing, and controlling threads, such as `Start()`, `Join()`, `Sleep()`, and `Abort()`.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">6. What is thread synchronization?</div>
            <div class="answer">Thread synchronization ensures that multiple threads do not interfere with each other when accessing shared resources. It prevents issues like race conditions and guarantees thread safety using techniques like locks, semaphores, and monitors.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">7. What is a race condition?</div>
            <div class="answer">A race condition occurs when two or more threads attempt to modify shared data concurrently, leading to unpredictable results. Synchronization is needed to avoid race conditions.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">8. How do you prevent race conditions in multithreading?</div>
            <div class="answer">Race conditions can be prevented by using thread synchronization techniques, such as locking (`lock` keyword in C#), `Monitor`, `Mutex`, or `Semaphore`, to control access to shared resources.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">9. What is the purpose of the `lock` keyword in C#?</div>
            <div class="answer">The `lock` keyword in C# is used to ensure that only one thread can access a block of code at a time. It helps prevent race conditions by acquiring a mutual-exclusion lock on the specified object.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">10. What is deadlock in multithreading?</div>
            <div class="answer">Deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other to release resources. It happens when threads acquire locks in a circular dependency.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">11. How do you avoid deadlocks in multithreading?</div>
            <div class="answer">Deadlocks can be avoided by ensuring that threads acquire locks in a consistent order, using timeouts for acquiring locks, and avoiding nested locks where possible.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">12. What is the difference between `Monitor` and `lock`?</div>
            <div class="answer">`lock` is a C# shorthand for `Monitor.Enter` and `Monitor.Exit`. While both are used to acquire and release locks, `Monitor` provides more fine-grained control, such as the ability to implement timeouts and checking if a lock can be acquired.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">13. What is the `ThreadPool` in .NET?</div>

        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">14. How does the `ThreadPool` improve performance?</div>
            <div class="answer">By reusing threads, the `ThreadPool` reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction. It helps manage thread execution efficiently, especially in high-performance applications with many short-lived tasks.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">15. What is the difference between `Thread` and `Task`?</div>
            <div class="answer">A `Thread` is a lower-level construct that is directly managed by the operating system, while a `Task` is a higher-level abstraction that is part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL) and is managed by the .NET runtime for easier parallel programming.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">16. What is the `Task Parallel Library (TPL)`?</div>

        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">23. What is `CancellationToken`?</div>
            <div class="answer">`CancellationToken` is a structure used for cooperative cancellation of tasks. It allows tasks to monitor a cancellation request and terminate gracefully when requested.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">24. How do you cancel a task in .NET?</div>
            <div class="answer">You can cancel a task by passing a `CancellationToken` to it. The task should periodically check for cancellation and terminate if requested using `CancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested()`.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
            <div class="question">25. What is `Task.WhenAll` and `Task.WhenAny`?</div>
