        <p class="answer">Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is a set of methods and syntax in C# that allows querying of collections in a concise and readable way.</p>

        <p class="question">9. What are generics in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">Generics allow you to define a class, method, delegate, or interface with a placeholder for the type of data it stores or uses. This allows for type safety without compromising performance or code redundancy.</p>

        <p class="question">10. Explain the concept of extension methods.</p>
        <p class="answer">Extension methods allow you to add methods to existing types without modifying the original type, creating a new derived type, or recompiling the original type. They are defined as static methods in a static class but are called as if they were instance methods on the extended type.</p>

        <p class="question">11. What is the difference between IEnumerable<T> and IQueryable<T>?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">16. What is polymorphism in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows methods to do different things based on the object it is acting upon. In C#, polymorphism can be achieved through method overriding and method overloading.</p>

        <p class="question">17. What are abstract classes in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated and is intended to be inherited by other classes. It can contain abstract methods, which are methods without implementation.</p>

        <p class="question">18. What is an interface in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">An interface defines a contract that implementing classes must adhere to. It can contain method, property, event, and indexer declarations, but no implementations.</p>

        <p class="question">19. Explain the difference between throw and throw ex in C#.</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>throw preserves the original stack trace of the exception.</li>
                <li>throw ex resets the stack trace, which can make it harder to debug.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">20. What is dependency injection?</p>
        <p class="answer">Dependency injection is a design pattern used to implement IoC (Inversion of Control), where the creation and binding of dependencies are managed by an external entity (like a container), rather than by the dependent class itself.</p>

        <p class="question">21. What is the difference between Task and Thread in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>

                <li>Method overloading is the ability to create multiple methods with the same name but with different signatures (parameters).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">27. What is a property in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they actually use special methods called accessors.</p>

        <p class="question">28. Explain the difference between encapsulation and abstraction in C#.</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components.</li>
                <li>Abstraction is the concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of the object. It simplifies the complexity by allowing the programmer to focus on interactions at a higher level.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">29. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous methods in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>

                <li>Asynchronous methods allow the calling thread to continue execution while the method runs in the background.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">30. What is an event in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">An event is a message sent by an object to signal the occurrence of an action. Events are declared using delegates and can be used to implement custom event-handling functionality.</p>

        <p class="question">31. Explain the difference between early binding and late binding in C#.</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Early binding refers to compile-time binding where the method and property names are checked during compilation.</li>
                <li>Late binding refers to runtime binding where method and property names are resolved at runtime, typically using reflection.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">32. What is the difference between a value type and a reference type in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Value types are stored in the stack and contain the actual data.</li>
                <li>Reference types are stored in the heap and contain a reference to the actual data.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">33. What is the IDisposable interface used for in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">The IDisposable interface is used to release unmanaged resources such as file handles, database connections, etc. It contains a single method, Dispose(), which is called to perform the necessary cleanup.</p>

        <p class="question">34. What are partial classes in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">Partial classes allow the definition of a class to be split across multiple files. This is useful for managing large classes or for separating automatically generated code from manually written code.</p>

        <p class="question">35. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>An abstract class can have implementations for some of its members, while an interface cannot have any implementations.</li>
                <li>A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can inherit from only one abstract class.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">36. What is a sealed class in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A sealed class is a class that cannot be inherited. It is used to prevent other classes from inheriting from it and overriding its behavior.</p>

        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Covariance allows you to use a more derived type than originally specified.</li>
                <li>Contravariance allows you to use a less derived type than originally specified.</li>
                <li>Covariance and contravariance are typically used with generics and delegates.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">38. What is a lambda expression in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A lambda expression is a concise way to represent an anonymous method. It is often used to create delegates or expression tree types.</p>

        <p class="question">39. What is the purpose of the dynamic keyword in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">The dynamic keyword bypasses compile-time type checking. It allows for the resolution of method calls and member accesses at runtime, providing a form of late binding.</p>

                <li>Task.Delay creates a task that completes after a specified amount of time, allowing the thread to remain available for other tasks in the meantime.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">42. What is the purpose of the GC.Collect() method in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">The GC.Collect() method forces an immediate garbage collection of all generations. It is generally recommended to let the garbage collector manage memory automatically, but GC.Collect() can be used in specific scenarios where immediate cleanup is necessary.</p>

        <p class="question">43. What is an iterator in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">An iterator is a method that uses the yield return statement to return each element of a collection one at a time. Iterators provide a way to iterate through a collection without exposing its underlying structure.</p>

        <p class="question">44. What is the difference between abstract method and virtual method?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">45. What is a static constructor in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A static constructor is used to initialize static members of a class. It is called automatically before the first instance is created or any static members are accessed.</p>

        <p class="question">46. What is the difference between a struct and a class in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Structs are value types and are stored on the stack, whereas classes are reference types and are stored on the heap.</li>
                <li>Structs are typically used for small data structures that contain primarily data and no complex behavior.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">47. Explain the purpose of the volatile keyword in C#.</p>
        <p class="answer">The volatile keyword indicates that a field can be modified by multiple threads that are executing simultaneously. It prevents the compiler from applying certain optimizations that assume single-threaded access.</p>

        <p class="question">48. What is a destructor in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A destructor is used to perform cleanup operations on unmanaged resources held by an object. It is called automatically by the garbage collector before the object is reclaimed.</p>

        <p class="question">49. What is a namespace in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A namespace is a way to organize and group related classes, interfaces, enums, and other types. It helps to avoid name collisions and to structure code in a logical manner.</p>

                <li>A private constructor cannot be called from outside the class and is often used in singleton patterns.</li>
                <li>A protected constructor can be called from within the class or by derived classes.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">51. What is an anonymous type in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">An anonymous type is a type that does not have a name and is used to encapsulate a set of read-only properties. It is often used in LINQ queries to create objects with properties based on query results.</p>

        <p class="question">52. What is a Tuple in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A Tuple is a data structure that can hold a fixed number of items of different types. It is used to return multiple values from a method in a single object.</p>

        <p class="question">53. What is the purpose of the default keyword in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">The default keyword is used to specify the default value of a type parameter or to initialize a variable with the default value of its type.</p>

        <p class="question">54. What is the purpose of the params keyword in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">The params keyword allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments. It is used to create methods that can handle different numbers of arguments without requiring overloads.</p>

        <p class="question">55. What is a dynamic object in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A dynamic object is an object whose type is determined at runtime rather than compile time. The dynamic keyword is used to declare such objects and allows for operations to be resolved dynamically.</p>

        <p class="question">56. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>A shallow copy creates a new object but does not create copies of objects that the original object references.</li>
                <li>A deep copy creates a new object and also recursively copies all objects referenced by the original object.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">57. What is a method group in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A method group is a collection of methods with the same name but different signatures. It allows for methods to be referenced and invoked using a single name, and is often used in conjunction with delegates.</p>

        <p class="question">58. What is a reference type in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A reference type is a type that stores a reference to its data rather than the data itself. Examples include classes, arrays, and delegates.</p>

        <p class="question">59. What is a value type in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">A value type is a type that directly contains its data. Examples include integers, floats, and structs.</p>

        <p class="question">60. What is the purpose of the virtual keyword in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">The virtual keyword is used to indicate that a method or property can be overridden in a derived class. It allows for runtime polymorphism by enabling derived classes to provide a specific implementation.</p>

        <p class="question">61. What is the difference between an interface and an abstract class in C#?</p>
        <p class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>Interfaces cannot contain any implementation, whereas abstract classes can contain both abstract and concrete methods.</li>
                <li>Interfaces are implemented using the `: interface` syntax, whereas abstract classes are inherited using the `: base` syntax.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p class="question">62. What is the purpose of the new keyword in C#?</p>
