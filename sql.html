            <div class="section-title">1. What is SQL?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language used to manage and manipulate relational databases. It is used to perform tasks such as querying data, updating records, and managing database structures.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="section-title">2. What are the different types of SQL statements?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p>SQL statements can be categorized into several types:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Data Query Language (DQL):</strong> SELECT</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Definition Language (DDL):</strong> CREATE, ALTER, DROP</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Manipulation Language (DML):</strong> INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</li>
                        <li><strong>Data Control Language (DCL):</strong> GRANT, REVOKE</li>

            <div class="section-title">3. What is the difference between a PRIMARY KEY and a UNIQUE KEY?</div>
            <div class="answer">
                <p><strong>PRIMARY KEY:</strong> Uniquely identifies each record in a table. A table can have only one PRIMARY KEY, and it cannot contain NULL values.</p>
                <p><strong>UNIQUE KEY:</strong> Ensures that all values in a column are unique. Unlike PRIMARY KEY, a table can have multiple UNIQUE constraints, and UNIQUE columns can contain NULL values (though only one NULL is allowed).</p>

            <div class="answer">
                <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. The types of normalization include:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>First Normal Form (1NF):</strong> Ensures that each column contains atomic values and each record is unique.</li>
                        <li><strong>Second Normal Form (2NF):</strong> Achieves 1NF and removes partial dependencies, where non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key.</li>
                        <li><strong>Third Normal Form (3NF):</strong> Achieves 2NF and removes transitive dependencies, ensuring that non-key attributes are not dependent on other non-key attributes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF):</strong> A stricter version of 3NF that deals with certain types of anomalies not covered by 3NF.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fourth Normal Form (4NF):</strong> Removes multi-valued dependencies.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fifth Normal Form (5NF):</strong> Removes join dependencies and ensures that all facts are represented without redundancy.</li>
                    </ul>
