        <!-- Question 1 to 20 -->
        <div class="question">1. What is SQL?</div>
        <div class="answer">SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate databases. It allows you to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from relational database systems.</div>

        <div class="question">2. What are the different types of SQL statements?</div>
        <div class="answer">SQL statements can be categorized into the following types:
            <ul>
                <li>DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP</li>
                <li>DML (Data Manipulation Language): SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE</li>
                <li>DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE</li>
                <li>TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">3. What is a Primary Key?</div>
        <div class="answer">A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. It ensures that no two rows in the table have the same value for the primary key field, and it cannot contain NULL values.</div>

        <div class="question">4. What is the difference between INNER JOIN and LEFT JOIN?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>INNER JOIN: Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.</li>
                <li>LEFT JOIN: Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">5. What is normalization in SQL?</div>
        <div class="answer">Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller tables and using relationships between them.</div>

        <div class="question">6. What is a Foreign Key?</div>
        <div class="answer">A foreign key is a field in a table that links to the primary key of another table. It creates a relationship between two tables and ensures referential integrity.</div>

        <div class="question">7. What is the difference between UNION and UNION ALL?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>UNION: Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements and removes duplicate rows.</li>
                <li>UNION ALL: Combines the results of two or more SELECT statements without removing duplicates.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">8. What is an index in SQL?</div>
        <div class="answer">An index is a database object that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space and slower updates. It is created on one or more columns of a table to speed up SELECT queries.</div>

        <div class="question">9. What is the difference between DELETE and TRUNCATE?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>DELETE: Removes rows from a table based on a condition, and can be rolled back (transactional).</li>
                <li>TRUNCATE: Removes all rows from a table, and cannot be rolled back (non-transactional). It is faster than DELETE.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">10. What is a subquery?</div>
        <div class="answer">A subquery is a query embedded within another query, often used to return a value that is used in the outer query's WHERE, FROM, or SELECT clauses.</div>

        <div class="question">11. What is a View?</div>
        <div class="answer">A view is a virtual table that is based on the result of a SELECT query. It does not store data physically but provides a way to encapsulate complex queries for reuse.</div>

        <div class="question">12. What is a Stored Procedure?</div>
        <div class="answer">A stored procedure is a precompiled collection of one or more SQL statements that can be executed as a single unit. It is stored in the database and can be called to perform specific operations.</div>

        <div class="question">13. What is a Trigger?</div>
        <div class="answer">A trigger is a set of SQL statements that automatically execute in response to certain events on a particular table or view, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE operations.</div>

        <div class="question">14. What is the difference between HAVING and WHERE?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>WHERE: Filters rows before aggregation (used with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).</li>
                <li>HAVING: Filters rows after aggregation (used with GROUP BY clause).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">15. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>CHAR: Fixed-length character data type. It always occupies the same amount of storage, regardless of the string length.</li>
                <li>VARCHAR: Variable-length character data type. It only uses the amount of storage required for the actual string length.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">16. What is the purpose of the SQL GROUP BY clause?</div>
        <div class="answer">The GROUP BY clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows, like counting the number of rows, summing a column, etc.</div>

        <div class="question">17. What is an aggregate function?</div>
        <div class="answer">An aggregate function performs a calculation on a set of values and returns a single value. Common aggregate functions include COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.</div>

        <div class="question">18. What is the difference between RANK() and DENSE_RANK()?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <ul>
                <li>RANK(): Assigns a rank to each row in the result set, with gaps in the rank sequence for ties.</li>
                <li>DENSE_RANK(): Similar to RANK(), but without gaps in the rank sequence for ties.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="question">19. What is a Self Join?</div>

        <div class="question">21. What is the use of the EXISTS operator in SQL?</div>
        <div class="answer">The EXISTS operator is used to check if a subquery returns any results. It returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more rows, and FALSE otherwise.</div>

        <div class="question">22. How would you retrieve unique records from a table?</div>
        <div class="answer">You can retrieve unique records using the DISTINCT keyword in a SELECT statement. Example: `SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name;`</div>

        <div class="question">23. What is the use of the IN operator?</div>
        <div class="answer">The IN operator is used to check if a value matches any value in a specified list or subquery. Example: `SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('HR', 'IT');`</div>

        <div class="question">24. What is a Cartesian Join?</div>
        <div class="answer">A Cartesian join (also called a cross join) returns the Cartesian product of two tables, i.e., it returns all possible combinations of rows from both tables.</div>

        <div class="question">25. What is a Data Integrity Constraint?</div>
        <div class="answer">Data integrity constraints ensure the accuracy and reliability of data in the database. Examples include PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and CHECK constraints.</div>
