    <h1>Top 100 Entity Framework Interview Questions and Answers</h1>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">1. What is Entity Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">Entity Framework (EF) is an open-source object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications. It enables developers to work with databases using .NET objects, eliminating the need for most of the data-access code.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">2. What are the advantages of using Entity Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            - Eliminates the need for most of the data-access code<br>
            - Supports LINQ queries<br>
            - Offers change tracking and lazy loading<br>
            - Reduces development time
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">3. What are the different approaches in Entity Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            - Database First<br>
            - Model First<br>
            - Code First
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">4. What is Code First approach?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Code First, the database is created from the code. You define your model classes first, and then EF generates the database schema based on those classes.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">5. What is Database First approach?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Database First, you start with an existing database, and EF generates entity classes and the DbContext based on the database schema.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">6. What is Model First approach?</div>
        <div class="answer">In Model First, you design your data model visually using the EF Designer, and then EF generates both the database schema and the code from the model.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">7. What is DbContext in Entity Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">DbContext is the primary class in EF that manages the database connection and is used to retrieve and save data. It represents a session with the database.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">8. What is the difference between DbContext and ObjectContext?</div>
        <div class="answer">DbContext is a wrapper around ObjectContext introduced in EF 4.1 to simplify coding. It provides a more streamlined API and is recommended for most modern applications. ObjectContext is more powerful but more complex and typically used in advanced scenarios.</div>

    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">10. How does EF handle relationships?</div>
        <div class="answer">EF handles relationships using navigation properties, foreign keys, and configurations through Data Annotations or Fluent API.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">11. What is Lazy Loading?</div>
        <div class="answer">Lazy Loading means related data is automatically loaded from the database when it is accessed through a navigation property.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">12. What is Eager Loading?</div>
        <div class="answer">Eager Loading is the process of loading related entities as part of the initial query using the Include method.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">13. What is Explicit Loading?</div>
        <div class="answer">Explicit Loading is when you manually load related entities using the Load method on a navigation property.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">14. What are navigation properties?</div>
        <div class="answer">Navigation properties in EF represent relationships between entities, like foreign keys in a relational database.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">15. How can you configure relationships in EF?</div>
        <div class="answer">Relationships can be configured using Data Annotations or Fluent API to specify multiplicity and foreign key constraints.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">16. What is the Fluent API in Entity Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">Fluent API provides a way to configure entity classes using method chaining instead of attributes.</div>

        <div class="answer">Add-Migration creates a migration file based on changes made to the model, while Update-Database applies migrations to the database.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">28. How do you handle concurrency conflicts in Entity Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">Concurrency conflicts are handled by using optimistic concurrency, where the EF checks for conflicting changes before saving data. You can implement it using timestamps or version columns in the database.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">29. What is a composite key in Entity Framework?</div>
        <div class="answer">A composite key is a primary key made up of more than one column in a table. You can configure composite keys using the Fluent API.</div>

        <div class="question">32. What is a stored procedure in EF, and how do you execute it?</div>
        <div class="answer">A stored procedure is a precompiled SQL query that can be executed by the database. In EF, you can execute it using `DbContext.Database.SqlQuery` or `DbContext.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand`.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">33. What is the difference between `First()` and `FirstOrDefault()`?</div>
        <div class="answer">`First()` throws an exception if no element is found, whereas `FirstOrDefault()` returns `null` when no elements match the query.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="qa">
        <div class="question">34. What is the `AsNoTracking()` method used for?</div>
        <div class="answer">`AsNoTracking()` is used to query data without tracking changes in the context, which improves performance for read-only queries.</div>
