            <div class="answer">
                <p>Razor Pages are a feature in ASP.NET Core that provides a more page-centric approach to web development compared to MVC Views. Each Razor Page consists of a .cshtml file with embedded C# code and a PageModel class that handles the page’s logic. Unlike MVC Views, which are tightly coupled with controllers and action methods, Razor Pages are self-contained and better suited for scenarios with simple pages and CRUD operations.</p>
