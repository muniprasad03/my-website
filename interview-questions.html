        <div class="qa">
            <h2>1. What is the difference between `ref` and `out` parameters in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">`ref` parameters require that the variable be initialized before it is passed. `out` parameters do not require initialization before being passed but must be assigned a value before the method returns.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>2. Explain the difference between `IEnumerable` and `IQueryable`.</h2>
            <p class="answer">`IEnumerable` is used for querying collections in-memory and executes queries in-memory. `IQueryable` is used for querying data from an external source, like a database, and can execute queries on the data source.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>3. What is a `delegate` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A `delegate` is a type that represents references to methods with a particular parameter list and return type. Delegates are used to pass methods as arguments and define callback methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>4. How does garbage collection work in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Garbage collection automatically reclaims memory by removing objects that are no longer in use. It works in generations and uses algorithms like mark-and-sweep to clean up unused objects.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>5. What are `async` and `await` used for in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">`async` and `await` are used to simplify asynchronous programming. `async` marks a method as asynchronous, while `await` is used to pause the execution of the method until the awaited task completes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>6. What is the purpose of the `using` statement in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">The `using` statement ensures that objects that implement `IDisposable` are disposed of properly. It provides a convenient syntax for ensuring that resources are cleaned up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>7. What are `abstract` classes and `interfaces` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">An `abstract` class can provide default implementations and cannot be instantiated. An `interface` only defines method signatures and properties without implementations. Classes that implement an interface must provide the implementations.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>8. Explain the concept of `inheritance` in C#.</h2>
            <p class="answer">Inheritance allows a class to inherit members (fields, methods, properties) from another class. This promotes code reusability and establishes an "is-a" relationship between classes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>9. What is the difference between `override` and `new` keywords in method hiding?</h2>
            <p class="answer">`override` is used to provide a new implementation of a method inherited from a base class. `new` is used to hide a method inherited from a base class, which does not change the base class method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>10. What is a `constructor` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated. It is used to initialize the object and set default values for its fields.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>13. How do you handle exceptions in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Exceptions are handled using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and `throw` blocks. `try` contains code that may throw an exception, `catch` handles the exception, and `finally` contains code that executes regardless of whether an exception was thrown.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>14. What is the difference between `Task` and `Thread` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">`Task` represents an asynchronous operation and is part of the Task Parallel Library (TPL). `Thread` is a lower-level construct used to perform tasks concurrently.</p>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>19. What are `properties` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Properties are members of a class that provide a mechanism to read, write, or compute the values of private fields through `get` and `set` accessors.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>20. What is the purpose of the `readonly` keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">The `readonly` keyword specifies that a field can only be assigned at its declaration or in a constructor of the same class. It ensures that the fieldâ€™s value remains constant after initialization.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>21. How does `string` interning work in C#?</h2>

        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>25. Explain `method overriding` in C#.</h2>
            <p class="answer">Method overriding allows a derived class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. It uses the `override` keyword.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>26. What is the `volatile` keyword in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">The `volatile` keyword is used to indicate that a field can be accessed by multiple threads and prevents the compiler from applying optimizations that assume the field does not change unexpectedly.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>27. What is the purpose of `extension methods` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code. They are defined in static classes and can be used as if they were instance methods.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>28. What is `type casting` and what types of casting exist in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Type casting is converting a variable from one type to another. Types of casting in C# include implicit casting, explicit casting, the `as` operator, and the `Convert` class.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>29. What are `generics` in C#?</h2>

            <h2>64. What are `access modifiers` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Access modifiers control the visibility of types and members. The main access modifiers are `public`, `private`, `protected`, `internal`, and `protected internal`, each defining different levels of access control.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>65. How do you use `Nullable` types in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Nullable types allow value types to represent null values. They are defined using the `?` operator (e.g., `int?`) and can be used to handle situations where a value type may not have a value.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>66. What is the `nameof` operator in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">The `nameof` operator returns the name of a variable, type, or member as a string. It helps avoid hardcoded strings and provides compile-time checking for member names.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>67. What are `attributes` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Attributes provide a way to add metadata to code elements. They are defined by creating custom attribute classes and can be used to influence the behavior of code at runtime or compile time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>68. What is `method hiding` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Method hiding allows a derived class to define a method with the same name as a method in the base class but with a different implementation. It uses the `new` keyword to indicate that the method hides the base class method.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>69. How do you create a `custom collection` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">To create a custom collection, implement the `IEnumerable<T>` interface and provide the necessary methods for iteration. You may also implement `ICollection<T>` and `IList<T>` for more functionality.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>70. What is `dependency inversion` principle in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">The Dependency Inversion Principle is one of the SOLID principles that states high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>71. What is `constructor chaining` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Constructor chaining is a technique where one constructor calls another constructor in the same class using the `this` keyword. This is useful for code reuse and initializing multiple constructors with common logic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>72. How do you implement `logging` in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Logging in C# can be implemented using various libraries like `NLog`, `log4net`, or the built-in `ILogger` in ASP.NET Core. These libraries provide functionality to log information, warnings, and errors to various outputs such as files, databases, or consoles.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>73. What is the `async` keyword used for?</h2>
            <p class="answer">The `async` keyword is used to mark a method as asynchronous, allowing it to use the `await` keyword within its body. It enables non-blocking operations and improves responsiveness by allowing other operations to run concurrently.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>74. How does `thread synchronization` work in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Thread synchronization in C# is achieved using synchronization primitives like `lock`, `Monitor`, `Mutex`, `Semaphore`, and `ReaderWriterLock`. These tools help manage concurrent access to shared resources and prevent race conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="qa">
            <h2>75. What are `extension methods` and how are they used in C#?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Extension methods allow you to add new methods to existing types without modifying their source code. They are defined in static classes and can be used to extend functionality for types like `string`, `int`, or custom types.</p>
